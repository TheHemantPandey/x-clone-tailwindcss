# X (Twitter) UI Clone using Tailwind CSS


🚀 Live Demo

https://thehemantpandey.github.io/X-Clone-tailwindcss/

A responsive frontend UI clone of **X (formerly Twitter)** built using **HTML and Tailwind CSS**.  
This project was created after learning Tailwind CSS to enhance my practical understanding of utility-first CSS and modern UI layout techniques.

## 🔍 About the Project
This project focuses purely on **frontend UI development**.  
It recreates the visual layout of X (Twitter) to practice building real-world interfaces using Tailwind CSS.  
There is no backend functionality such as authentication, posting, or database integration.
